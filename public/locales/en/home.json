    "description": "To outline the panorama of Education in Human Rights in Brazil, the research was divided into two stages. In the first, we sought to understand institutionalization at the federal level, using information linked to the Ministry of Women, Family and Human Rights where the EDH entity is located; in the second, the Brazilian states were analyzed with the intention of understanding the extent to which EDH is institutionalized in each location. Information was collected considering two bienniums: 2019-2020 and 2021-2022. The research was carried out using information available on official websites, by email and by telephone. The information on satisfactory states in this infographic corresponds to the second biennium. To obtain more detailed data for each state,",
